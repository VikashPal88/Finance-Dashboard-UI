## 🧠 Approach & Design Decisions

### State Management
- **Zustand** with `persist` middleware stores transactions, accounts, budget alerts, role, and theme in `localStorage`
- Accounts support full CRUD with budget tracking per account
- Budget alerts are auto-generated when monthly expenses reach 90% of an account's budget
- Filters include account-based filtering alongside category and type

### UI Architecture
- **Next.js App Router** implementation for authentic URL routing (`/settings`, `/insights`, `/transactions`, etc.) rather than simulated SPA state routing.
- **Tailwind CSS v4** architecture dynamically mapping CSS custom properties inside `:root` (for Dark mode) and `[data-theme="light"]` (for Light mode) through `@theme inline` to prevent React hydration issues.
- Integrated **Shadcn UI** for elegant Form interactions, Popovers, and Dropdown management.
- Components are organized by feature domain (dashboard, transactions, insights, accounts)
- Custom reusable UI components: `ToggleSwitch`, `RoleToggle`, `MiniCalendar`, `Badge`, `EmptyState`
- Role toggle uses Framer Motion `layoutId` for smooth sliding animation

### Accounts System
- Users can create multiple accounts for different spending purposes (food, travel, bills, etc.)
- Each account has an icon, color, and optional monthly budget
- Transactions are linked to accounts via `accountId`
- The default account cannot be deleted; if a non-default account is deleted, its transactions are moved to the default account
- Budget alerts simulate email notifications (frontend-only) with dismiss functionality

### Budget Alert System
- When monthly expenses for any account reach 90% of its budget, a visual alert is triggered
- Alerts appear as notification badges in the header bell icon
- Alerts also appear as banner notifications on the Accounts page
- Shows simulated "email alert would be sent" message
- Users can dismiss alerts individually

### Responsiveness
- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind responsive breakpoints
- Sidebar collapses to icon-only on toggle, hamburger menu on mobile
- Cards stack vertically on small screens, grid on larger screens
- Role toggle moves to profile dropdown on mobile

### Data
- 67 realistic transactions in Indian context (INR currency)
- Spans 6 months (Oct 2025 – Mar 2026)
- Diverse categories covering income and expenses
- 4 default accounts (Main, Food & Dining, Travel, Bills & Utilities)

### RBAC
- Frontend-only simulation — no auth/backend needed
- Role stored in Zustand and persisted
- UI conditionally renders add/edit/delete controls based on role
- Admin vs Viewer toggle with premium animated switch component

## 📋 Assumptions

1. This is a frontend-only project — no backend or API integration required
2. Data is seeded via mock data; new data persists in localStorage
3. Currency is Indian Rupee (₹) formatted with en-IN locale
4. Role switching is a demonstration feature — no actual authentication
5. Charts use Recharts for React-native integration support
6. Budget email alerts are simulated on the frontend — no actual emails are sent
7. Account budgets are monthly (resets conceptually each month)
